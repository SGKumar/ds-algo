# My source code for Amazon Prep

1. I'm using Ant for building just because it is very easy and simple to add tasks to run my code
2. Code is structured based on topics (initially from Karumanchi book).
3. Different book's codes are in separate directories.
4. Can search for CTCI/Harry/Gainlo/Pie with the #CTCI type pattern
